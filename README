## Synopsis

**box_merge** is a utility tool for tesseract OCR engine training process. This
tool merges boxes of Arabic script, corresponding to their join class specified
in the Unicode Standard.

## Usage

Call `box_merge` with this arguments:

```
box_merge -i INPUT_BOX_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE -u ARABIC_SHAPING
```
`INPUT_FILE` The input box file

`OUTPUT_FILE` The output box file.

`ARABIC_SHAPING` This file is a part of UCD that describes joining classes of
all characters in range 9-3, 9-8, 9-9, 9-10, 9-14, 9-15, 9-16, 9-19, 9-20, 10-4,
10-5, 10-6, 10-7, and 19-5 of The Unicode Standard core specification. This file
(Usually named `ArabicShaping.txt`) is available in
[UCD](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/ArabicShaping.txt).

## Motivation

Tesseract OCR is an excellent OCR engine, providing custom languages, fonts and
tools for generating trained data. Unfortunately tesseract training tools come
short for complex scripts like Arabic. By its nature, Arabic language is written
from right to left, and follows a joining mechanism. Ignoring these features,
leads us to an unsufficient toolset for training tesseract OCR data for Persian,
Arabic, Indic, etc.

This project provides a tool to enhance `.box` files generated by
`text2image`. Following changes will be applied after running `box_merge`:

 * The order of box entries will be reversed to meet RTL language
   needs. (Basically correct merging);
 * Box Definition entries in the input file will be merged together following
   Unicode Annex #44 joining classes.

## Installation

Simple steps for compiling and installing `box_merge`:

```
./configure
make
make install
```
